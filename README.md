# Homework Seven

## Adding a responsive tours page and individual tour package pages to the Travel-fly prototype.

I learned how to use Mixins and create multiple pages from a CSS class. I used percentages and media queries to make my site responsive and adaptable. I also learned how to make a turn my navigation into a hamburger menu once it reached a certain pixel width targeted for most mobile devices. 

Mixins have been extremely helpful with keeping my code organized, readable, and clean. I really enjoy using them.
