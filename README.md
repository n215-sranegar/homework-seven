# Homework Seven


## Adding responsive special offers, blog, and contact pages to the Travel-fly prototype.

I used percentages and media queries to make my site responsive and adaptable and used Mixins to consolidate my code. I added a Mixin for the site button and arguments for changing the radius, width, height, and font size when needed. I will implement JQuery for the next assignment to make the website dynamic.
